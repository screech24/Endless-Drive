The game will use three.js for rendering, ensuring smooth performance across different devices.

Features and Mechanics
The game will include:

Procedurally Generated Tracks: Tracks are created on the fly, offering a new experience each playthrough, with segments like straight paths and curves.
Multiple Cars: Players can choose from various cars, each with unique handling characteristics, enhancing personalization.
Obstacles and Power-Ups: Random obstacles challenge players, while power-ups like speed boosts or shields add excitement.
High Score System: Players can track and share their best distances, potentially increasing viral potential through social media.
Customizable Controls: Options for keyboard or mouse steering ensure accessibility for different players.
Scenic Environments: Different themes (e.g., desert, forest, city) keep visuals interesting and engaging.
Unexpected Detail
An unexpected aspect is the potential for the game to include a sharing feature that generates a personalized link based on the player's score, encouraging social media sharing and increasing its viral potential, which is not commonly seen in simple driving games.

Survey Note: Detailed Design of "Endless Drive" 3D Driving Simulator
This note outlines the comprehensive design for "Endless Drive," a 3D driving simulator game built using three.js, intended for browser play with a focus on simplicity, fun, and viral potential. The design aims to balance engaging gameplay with polished visuals, ensuring accessibility and shareability to maximize its appeal.

Introduction and Background
The concept for "Endless Drive" emerged from the need for a browser-based 3D driving simulator that is easy to pick up yet offers depth for replayability. Given the popularity of similar games like "3D Car Simulator" on Poki and "PolyTrack" on itch.io, the game leverages three.js, a JavaScript library for 3D graphics, to ensure cross-browser compatibility and performance. The design draws inspiration from existing titles, such as the procedurally generated tracks in "slowroads.io" discussed on Reddit, aiming for a blend of arcade-style driving and scenic exploration.

Game Concept and Objectives
"Endless Drive" is designed as a single-player driving simulator where the player controls a car through a procedurally generated track, with the primary objective of driving as far as possible without crashing. The game targets casual gamers, focusing on fun and accessibility, while incorporating features to encourage sharing and viral growth, such as high score sharing on social media.

Detailed Features
Gameplay Mechanics
Core Movement: The player controls the car in a third-person view, with options for keyboard (WASD or arrow keys for steering, acceleration, and braking) or mouse steering. The car's movement is based on a simple kinematic model, updating position, velocity, and heading based on player input.
Track Generation: The track is procedurally generated using a series of connected segments, each defined by a spline or path. Segment types include straight sections, left and right curves, and forks, with random placement to ensure variety. As the player progresses, new segments are added, creating an endless track.
Obstacles and Challenges: Random obstacles, such as other cars, cones, or barrels, are placed on the track to challenge the player. Collision detection ensures the game ends if the car hits an obstacle or goes off the track.
Power-Ups: Collectible power-ups appear randomly, offering temporary benefits:
Speed Boost: Increases speed by 20% for 5 seconds.
Shield: Makes the car immune to obstacles for 10 seconds.
Nitro: Provides a one-time speed burst lasting 2 seconds. Visual feedback, such as particle effects, indicates power-up activation.
Scoring System: The player's score is based on the distance driven, with milestones or checkpoints increasing the score. High scores are stored locally, and players can share them via social media using the Web Share API or clipboard fallback.
Art and Visual Design
Models and Textures: The game uses stylized, low-poly 3D models for the car and track to ensure performance, with good lighting and shading for a polished look. Free models from repositories like itch.io can be adapted for three.js compatibility.
Environments: Multiple themes enhance visual interest, including:
Desert: Sandy terrain, cacti, dunes.
Forest: Trees, grass, winding paths.
City: Buildings, streets, traffic lights. Each theme has unique textures and models, selectable from the main menu.
Lighting and Effects: Dynamic lighting, such as a moving sun or day-night cycle, can be implemented for polish, with particle effects for dust, exhaust, or power-up activations.
Audio Design
Sound Effects: Engine sounds, tire screeching, collision noises, and power-up collection sounds enhance immersion.
Background Music: A fitting soundtrack, potentially varying by theme, adds to the atmosphere, with options for players to mute if preferred.
User Interface and Experience
Main Menu: Options include starting the game, choosing a car, selecting a theme, viewing high scores, and credits. Tutorials or tips for beginners explain controls and gameplay.
In-Game UI: Displays current score (distance driven), speed, and active power-ups. A pause menu allows resuming or quitting.
Game Over Screen: Shows final score, high score comparison, and sharing options, with buttons to play again or return to the menu.
Social and Viral Features
To enhance viral potential, the game includes:

High Score Sharing: Players can share their scores on social media, using a generated link or screenshot, captured via three.js canvas rendering.
Personalization: The procedurally generated track could incorporate player input, like their name, for a unique experience, encouraging sharing.
Leaderboards: While primarily local, the game could integrate with social platforms for score comparison, though this may require server-side support for scalability.
Implementation Details
Technology Stack: Built with three.js for 3D rendering, leveraging WebGL for performance. Basic physics are implemented using kinematic equations, with potential integration of Cannon.js for advanced physics if needed.
Performance Considerations: Optimized for browser play, using low-poly models and efficient rendering to ensure smooth performance across devices. Testing on different browsers and screen sizes is crucial, with adjustments for aspect ratios and camera views.
Development Process: Start with a basic track (straight line with curves), single car, and no obstacles, then iteratively add features like obstacles, power-ups, and multiple themes. Playtesting will balance difficulty, ensuring the track is challenging but accessible.
